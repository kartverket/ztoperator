                  AcceptedResources specifies resource indicators used to request an audience limited access token following [RFC8707](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8707).
                  It defines accepted audience resource indicators in the JWT token.

                  The resource indicators specified will be added to the initial authorize request towards the configured identity provider.
                  Each resource indicator must be a valid URI,
                  and the access token returned by the identity provider will set the resource indicators in the `aud` claim in the JWT token.
                  If none of the specified resource indicators is present in the `aud` claim in the JWT, the request will be denied.

                  Please note that this alone is not sufficient to securely restrict access to a resource based on the `aud` claim.
                  Use .allowedAudiences to specify one or more allowed client IDs.
